## Churn Report
**Project Objectives:**

- **Develop a Churn Prediction Model** ([Churn Power BI Visual Report]( https://github.com/Midoford/Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Exercise.pbix)): This objective focuses on building a predictive model using historical customer data to identify at-risk customers and forecast potential churn, aiding in proactive retention strategies.

- **Analyze Churn Drivers and Patterns:** This involves examining customer behaviors and characteristics to uncover key factors contributing to churn, enabling targeted interventions to improve customer retention and satisfaction.

**Purpose of Churn Analytics:**
- **Retention Strategy Optimization**: Identify at-risk customers to implement targeted retention campaigns, reducing churn rates and preserving revenue streams.  

- **Customer Insights & Segmentation**: Uncover patterns in customer behavior to refine segmentation, enabling personalized experiences and improving lifetime value (LTV).  

- **Product/Service Improvement**: Pinpoint pain points in the customer journey to enhance offerings, ensuring competitive advantage and long-term customer satisfaction.  


**Importance of Analyzing Sales Data:**

**1.** **Identifying At-Risk Customers:** It helps spot customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies like personalized offers or improved support to reduce churn.

**2.** **Improving Business Strategies:** Insights reveal weaknesses in products or services, guiding data-driven improvements to enhance customer satisfaction, retention, and long-term growth.

### ✅Analysis & Key Insights
- Churn Rate is 27.0% (1,732 customers out of 6,418 total).
- Month-to-Month contracts have the highest churn (46.5%) compared to Two-Year contracts (2.7%).
- The top Churn Category is "Competitor" (761 customers).
- Churn is exceptionally high for the Device Protection Plan (71.0%) and Internet Service (63.7%).
- The state of Jammu has the highest Churn Rate at 57.2%.

#
### ✅Conclusion & Recommendation 
Conclusion
- High overall churn is driven by short-term contracts and a significant loss of customers to competitors, likely due to dissatisfaction with specific services (Fiber Optic, Device Protection).
- Focus efforts on contract migration to stabilize the base and conduct immediate root-cause analysis on the poor-performing services.

#
### ✅Recommendation
- Implement aggressive incentives to move customers from Month-to-Month contracts to longer-term plans.
- Immediately investigate the quality or cost of the Fiber Optic and Device Protection Plan services due to their high churn rates.
- Initiate specific retention campaigns and service improvements in high-churn areas, starting with Jammu.
- Encourage a shift away from high-churn payment methods like Bank Withdrawal toward more automated options.
