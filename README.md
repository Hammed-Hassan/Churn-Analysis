# Churn Analysis Project
## Churn Report
**Project Objectives:**

- **Develop a Churn Prediction Model** ([Churn Power BI Visual Report]( https://github.com/Midoford/Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Exercise.pbix)): This objective focuses on building a predictive model using historical customer data to identify at-risk customers and forecast potential churn, aiding in proactive retention strategies.

- **Analyze Churn Drivers and Patterns:** This involves examining customer behaviors and characteristics to uncover key factors contributing to churn, enabling targeted interventions to improve customer retention and satisfaction.

**Purpose of Churn Analytics:**
- **Retention Strategy Optimization**: Identify at-risk customers to implement targeted retention campaigns, reducing churn rates and preserving revenue streams.  

- **Customer Insights & Segmentation**: Uncover patterns in customer behavior to refine segmentation, enabling personalized experiences and improving lifetime value (LTV).  

- **Product/Service Improvement**: Pinpoint pain points in the customer journey to enhance offerings, ensuring competitive advantage and long-term customer satisfaction.  


**Importance of Analyzing Sales Data:**

**1.** **Identifying At-Risk Customers:** It helps spot customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies like personalized offers or improved support to reduce churn.

**2.** **Improving Business Strategies:** Insights reveal weaknesses in products or services, guiding data-driven improvements to enhance customer satisfaction, retention, and long-term growth.
